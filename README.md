#problem statement
  Farmers often struggle to achieve sustainable profits due to exploitation by middlemen, unpredictable weather, and poor crop selection. Middlemen reduce their earnings by controlling market prices, while extreme weather and lack of timely information lead to significant crop losses. Additionally, farmers lack insights into market demand and soil-crop compatibility, resulting in suboptimal planting decisions.  
  An AI-driven solution is needed to address these issues by providing real-time weather forecasts, market price predictions, and data-driven crop recommendations. Leveraging predictive analytics, machine learning, and IoT, this solution can empower farmers to eliminate middlemen, make informed decisions, and improve yields. By addressing these challenges, we can ensure better incomes for farmers, promote sustainable agriculture, and enhance food security.
